            <li><p><strong>Where Do Small Firms Get Debt Financing? (with Sergiy Chernenko) </strong><br>Abstract: We use detailed claim-level data from bankruptcy filings to study the types and sources of debt financing used by small firms.More than half of firms in our data borrow from multiple lenders. Only 24% of firms have a bank as their sole lender; another 29\% borrow from both a bank and a nonbank financial institution (NBFI). About 17\% borrow only from NBFIs. We document the composition of debt financing in terms of credit cards, lines of credit, receivables financing, equipment financing, mortgages, and term loans. The smallest firms rely more on credit cards, receivables and equipment financing, while larger firms rely more on mortgages and lines of credit. Only half of loans in our data show up in the UCC filings, calling for caution in using UCC filings as a proxy for small business lending. We also examine the association between the structure of the local banking markets and the composition and sources of small business debt financing. Deposit concentration is associated with significantly lower share of bank debt, especially credit cards. Firms in counties with high deposit concentration appear to substitute to mortgages from NBFIs. Finally, we investigate the presence of racial disparities in the utilization of different types of debt and lenders. Minority-owned firms might face challenges in accessing unsecured credit and have to rely more on secured loans such as mortgages from NBFIs.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Negative Capital Shock, Overseas Buyers, and Housing Market</strong> <br>Abstract: While local policies regarding foreign capital inflows into residential housing markets typically oscillate between promoting wealth effects and ensuring housing affordability, the majority of current literature focuses on the positive demand shocks to examine the necessity of implementing restrictions on foreign capital. In this paper, I explore the implications of a negative capital shock from China on local housing markets. By leveraging China's implementation of stricter foreign exchange purchase quota management for its citizens as an exogenous negative demand shock on foreign Chinese buyers in the US single-family homes market, my analysis reveals substantial effects on local housing assets. Not only did the volume of house transactions by foreign Chinese buyers significantly decline compared to other foreign ethnicities (Indian and Russian), but house prices also significantly dropped in neighborhoods that are popular among Chinese buyers. Furthermore, the elasticity of house supply, as implied by such a negative demand shock, is higher than that reported in existing literature. This provides an important rationale for why some cross-border bans or restrictions, aimed at curbing capital inflows and thus local house prices, proved ineffective.</p></li>
