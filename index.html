                <br><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                In this paper, I explore the implications of a negative capital shock from China on local housing markets.
                By leveraging China's implementation of stricter foreign exchange purchase quota management for its citizens as an exogenous negative demand shock on foreign Chinese buyers in the US single-family homes market, my analysis reveals substantial effects on local housing assets.
                Not only did the volume of house transactions by foreign Chinese buyers significantly decline compared to other foreign ethnicities (Indian and Russian), but house prices also significantly dropped in neighborhoods that are popular among Chinese buyers.
                However, the magnitude of the price drop is smaller than expected, especially when compared to positive demand shocks of similar magnitude reported in the literature.
                Additionally, the elasticity of housing supply, as implied by such a negative demand shock, is higher than that reported in existing literature.
                My findings explain why cross-border restrictions on capital inflows have had limited effects on local house prices and indicate that capital withdrawals by large corporate investors similarly may exert limited impact.

                <br><strong  style="font-style: italic;"> Best Paper in Financial Intermediation & Markets, Semi-finalist, FMA (2025) </strong>
                <br><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                We  use detailed claim-level data from bankruptcy filings to study the types and sources of debt financing
                used by small firms.
                About half of firms in our data borrow from multiple lenders; 29% borrow from both bank and nonbank
                lenders.
                Only 29% of firms borrow exclusively from banks.
                We report detailed descriptive statistics on the types of debt used by small firms: credit cards, lines
                of credit, receivables financing, equipment financing, mortgages, and term loans.
                The smallest firms rely more on credit cards, receivables and equipment financing, while larger firms
                rely more on mortgages and lines of credit.
                Only half of the loans in our data are associated with UCC financing statements, calling for caution in
                using UCC filings as a proxy for small business lending.
                We examine the association between the structure of the local banking markets and the composition and
                sources of small business debt financing.
                Deposit concentration is associated with significantly lower share of bank debt, especially credit
                cards.
                Firms in counties with high deposit concentration appear to substitute to receivables financing and to
                mortgages from nonbank lenders.
                In counties with larger banks, small firms also substitute from bank to nonbank lenders.
                Finally, we investigate the presence of racial disparities in the utilization of different types and
                sources of debt financing.
                Black-owned firms rely significantly less on credit cards and receivables financing and more on
                mortgages.
                Asian-owned firms are significantly less likely to get their debt from banks than observably similar
                white-owned firms.

            <li><p><strong>Racial Disparities in Home Sales to Large Investors (with Sergey Chernenko) </strong>
                <br><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                We show that minority homeowners are 45 - 120% more likely than white homeowners to sell to large buy-to-rent institutional investors.
                While location explains about half of the disparity in the propensity to sell to institutional investors, minority homeowners are still 20 - 40% more likely to sell to institutional investors than white homeowners selling observably comparable houses in the same census tract at the same time.
                We provide some evidence that minority homeowners are especially likely to sell to institutional investors in counties with historically larger disparity in prices at which Black homeowners sell their houses compared to white homeowners.
                We also explore the role of access to real estate agents of same race as the seller in the propensity to sell to institutional investors.
                Finally, we provide evidence of smaller disparities in sale prices when selling to buy-to-rent institutional investors and iBuyers, suggesting that their algorithmic pricing strategies help narrow racial price gaps in the housing market, especially for Black sellers.
