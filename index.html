                <br><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                While local policies regarding foreign capital inflows into residential housing markets typically
                oscillate between promoting wealth effects and ensuring housing affordability, the majority of current
                literature focuses on the positive demand shocks to examine the necessity of implementing restrictions
                on foreign capital. In this paper, I explore the implications of a negative capital shock from China on
                local housing markets. By leveraging China's implementation of stricter foreign exchange purchase quota
                management for its citizens as an exogenous negative demand shock on foreign Chinese buyers in the US
                single-family homes market, my analysis reveals substantial effects on local housing assets. Not only
                did the volume of house transactions by foreign Chinese buyers significantly decline compared to other
                foreign ethnicities (Indian and Russian), but house prices also significantly dropped in neighborhoods
                that are popular among Chinese buyers. However, the magnitude of price drop is smaller than expected,
                especially when compared to positive demand shocks of similar magnitude reported in the literature.
                Additionally, the elasticity of housing supply, as implied by such a negative demand shock, is higher
                than that reported in existing literature. My findings provide an important rationale for why some
                cross-border bans or restrictions, aimed at curbing capital inflows and thus local house prices, have
                had limited effects.

                <br><strong> R&R, Journal of Financial Intermediation</strong>

                <br><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                We  use detailed claim-level data from bankruptcy filings to study the types and sources of debt financing
                used by small firms.
                About half of firms in our data borrow from multiple lenders; 29% borrow from both bank and nonbank
                lenders.
                Only 29% of firms borrow exclusively from banks.
                We report detailed descriptive statistics on the types of debt used by small firms: credit cards, lines
                of credit, receivables financing, equipment financing, mortgages, and term loans.
                The smallest firms rely more on credit cards, receivables and equipment financing, while larger firms
                rely more on mortgages and lines of credit.
                Only half of the loans in our data are associated with UCC financing statements, calling for caution in
                using UCC filings as a proxy for small business lending.
                We examine the association between the structure of the local banking markets and the composition and
                sources of small business debt financing.
                Deposit concentration is associated with significantly lower share of bank debt, especially credit
                cards.
                Firms in counties with high deposit concentration appear to substitute to receivables financing and to
                mortgages from nonbank lenders.
                In counties with larger banks, small firms also substitute from bank to nonbank lenders.
                Finally, we investigate the presence of racial disparities in the utilization of different types and
                sources of debt financing.
                Black-owned firms rely significantly less on credit cards and receivables financing and more on
                mortgages.
                Asian-owned firms are significantly less likely to get their debt from banks than observably similar
                white-owned firms.
